# OpenClassrooms Project 3 - Film Festival

Analyze a client's needs for their film festival
 Brooklyn Outdoor Film Festival

 In this project, I have used HTML and CSS knowledge to build a static site from scratch! The main idea was to create a website for a person in my community who wants to launch an endeavor but isn't a coder themselves.

The HTML/CSS of the site should be as aesthetically pleasing as possible! Paying attention to detail, and communicating a sense of brand identity through your font, color, image, and sizing choices.  

Skills:

Write a project brief

Choose an appropriate technical solution

Detail project specifications

List functionalities requested by the client

HTML

Bootstrap

CSS

SASS
